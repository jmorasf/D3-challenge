          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty, Age, Income and Health Factors</h2>
          <p>By state, this study examines how certain health factors (Obesity, Smoking Population and No Health Insurance) are influenced by socio-economic factors, specifically Household Income, 
            Median Age and Poverty Rate.</p>
            <p>
            There is a positive correlation between Poverty Rate and Rate of Uninsured Individuals, Rate of Obesity and Rate of Smoking.
            Conversely there is negative correlation between Median Household Income and Rate of Uninsured Individuals, Rate of Obesity and Rate of Smoking. 
            Median Age does not seem to correlate strongly with the three selected Health Factors. However, there is a minor negative correlation between Median Age and the Rate of Smoking. 
            This seems to indicate that public education is working.</p>
            <p>
            Overall, these results confirm the expected outcome of the analysis.</p>
